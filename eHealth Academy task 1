	<H4> Author:Zain Bhikha</H4>
	<P>When I was born, the first words that I<br>
Had heard<br>
Were the words of Allah being whispered through my ear<br>
And as I felt Allah's power in my soul<br>
That day Islam took me in it's fold<p/>
<p>I am a muslim<br/>Islam my deen<br/>
Allah my Lord<br/>
His word Qur'an<br/>
Muhammad, Prophet<br/>
Praise be upon him<br/>
I am a Muslim for all of time<br/>
</p>
As I grew up, walking in this great big world<br/>
I gazed in awe at the wonders of Allah<br/>
And as I learned the cruel lessons of life<br/>
Islam shone through as my guiding light<br/>
<p>Look at me now, family around my deathbed<br/>
I know not when Allah will call me home<br/>
This life I led, o what a blessed thing<br/>
As death comes to me these words I<br/>
Will sing</P>
<p>I am a muslim<br/>Islam my deen<br/>
Allah my Lord<br/>
His word Qur'an<br/>
Muhammad, Prophet<br/>
Praise be upon him<br/>
I am a Muslim for all of time<br/>
</p>
